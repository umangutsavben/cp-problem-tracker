main observation was to see how to put the number after the 
we have to ignore 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1
                                x   x   x x x   x   x
ignore the 1 then we have to put all the zeros with the bits of the n!!
cuz to inc we have to shift the x (keeping the one in place) by n-1
