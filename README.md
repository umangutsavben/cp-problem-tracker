# Competitive Programming Tracker

This repository contains my solutions and learnings from:
- Codeforces
- LeetCode

## Goals
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Reach 1200+ on Codeforces
- Maintain a mistake-driven revision system

## Structure
- `codeforces/` → Problems by rating
- `leetcode/` → Problems by difficulty
- `notes/` → Mistakes and patterns

## Revision Rule
Any problem marked with a mistake must be re-solved after 7 days.
